ProDy 1.2 Release Notes
===============================================================================

1.2.1 (Sep 6, 2012)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from ProDy v1.1, see also the below changes introduced in
v1.2.

**Bugfix**:

  * A problem in :mod:`select` module regarding Numpy numeric types
    is fixed.  Problem would emerge on platforms which do not offer
    some numeric types, e.f. ``np.float16``.

  * Fixed problems in :ref:`prody-anm`, :ref:`prody-gnm`, and
    :ref:`prody-fetch` related to writing output files.

**Changes**:

  * The way that :ref:`prody-fetch` command handles files containing PDB
    identifiers has changed.


1.2 (Aug 30, 2012)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Important Changes**:

Package folder :file:`prody` is moved into :file:`lib` folder to prevent
exceptions related to importing compiled packages from the installation
folder.

Some changes in :class:`.Trajectory` and :class:`.Ensemble` methods related
to linking, setting, and selecting atoms were made to make the interface
more intuitive.  These changes, which may break your code, are as follows:

  * :class:`.AtomGroup` instances can be linked to a :class:`.Trajectory`
    using :meth:`.Trajectory.link` method and linking status of an instance
    can be checked using :meth:`.Trajectory.isLinked` medhod.

  * :meth:`.Trajectory.setAtoms` method accepts :class:`.AtomGroup` and
    :class:`.Selection` instances and should be used to select a subset
    of atoms.  This method will not link :class:`.AtomGroup` instance to the
    trajectory and also will not update the reference coordinates of the
    instance.

  * :meth:`.Trajectory.select` and :meth:`.Ensemble.select` methods are removed
    and their functions are overloaded to :meth:`.Trajectory.setAtoms`
    and :meth:`.Ensemble.setAtoms` methods, respectively.

  * :meth:`.Trajectory.getSelection` and :meth:`.Ensemble.getSelection`
    methods are removed, use :meth:`.Trajectory.getAtoms` and
    :meth:`.Ensemble.getAtoms` instead.

  * :class:`.Trajectory` reference coordinates must be changed using
    :meth:`.Trajectory.setCoords` method.

For usage examples see :ref:`trajectory`, :ref:`trajectory2`, :ref:`frame`,
and :ref:`outputtraj`.

**New Features**:

  * :ref:`flags`, that are used in :ref:`selections`, is implemented.  See its
    documentation for handy usage examples.

  * :func:`.sortAtoms` function is implemented.

  * :func:`.pickCentralConf` function is implemented to pick the conformation
    or the active coordinate set that is closest to the average of coordinate
    sets.

  * :func:`.writePSF`, a simple PSF file writer, is implemented.

  * :func:`.glob` utility function is implemented.

  * :func:`.iterPDBFilenames` function is implemented, which can be used to
    iterate over all PDB files stored in a local mirror of Protein Data Bank.

  * :func:`.findPDBFiles` function is implemented, which can be used to access
    PDB files in a path.


**Improvements**:

  * :class:`.HierView` instances are built more efficiently.  Two times
    speed-up is achieved by delaying instantiation of :class:`.Chain` and
    :class:`.Residue` instances until they are needed.

  * Multiple :ref:`flags` can be used in :ref:`selections` without using
    ``'and'`` operator, e.g. ``'sidechain carbon'`` is the same as
    ``'sidechain and carbon'``.

  * :func:`.writePDB` accepts :class:`.Ensemble`, :class:`.Conformation`,
    and :class:`.Frame` instances as atoms argument.

  * :func:`.writePDB` function is around 25% faster.

  * :func:`.pickCentral` is extended to accept :class:`.Atomic` and
    :class:`.Ensemble` instances. Old function is now :func:`.pickCentralAtom`.

  * :ref:`prody-align` command and :func:`.prody_align` function can handle
    non-protein atom selections (see examples for :ref:`prody-align`).

  * :func:`.parsePDB` and :func:`.writePDB` supports 100K and more atoms.

**Changes**:

  * :func:`.showOverlapTable` displays first set of modes along x axis of the
    plot.

  * :meth:`.AtomGroup.setData` does not accept arrays with boolean data type,
    use :meth:`.AtomGroup.setFlags` instead.

  * :func:`.writePDB` function argument *model* is changed to *csets* that
    indicates the coordinate set index of *atoms* argument.

  * :meth:`.PackageLogger.timing` does not return elapsed time, only logs this
    information.

  * :meth:`.PackageLogger.startLogfile` is deprecated for removal in v1.3, use
    :meth:`.PackageLogger.start` instead.

  * :meth:`.PackageLogger.closeLogfile` is deprecated for removal in v1.3, use
    :meth:`.PackageLogger.close` instead.

  * ``from prody.utilities import *`` will not work anymore due to potential
    name conflicts with Python standard library functions.  Import required
    functions explicitly.

  * :func:`.writePDB` appends :file:`.pdb` extension to filename when it is not
    present

  * :ref:`prody-select` command positional argument order is changed to allow
    for handling multiple PDBs at a time. Old older will be supported until
    v1.4, but a warning message will be issued.

  * *select* argument in :func:`.alignCoordsets` is removed, make selection
    outside of the function instead.

**Deprecations**:

  * :meth:`.AtomGroup.getHeteros` method has been deprecated for removal in
    v1.3, use ``getFlags('hetatm')`` instead.

  * :meth:`.AtomMap.getMappedFlags` and :meth:`.AtomMap.getDummyFlags`
    methods have been deprecated for removal in v1.3, use
    ``getFlags('mapped')`` and ``getFlags('dummy')`` instead.

  * :func:`.getVerbosity` and :func:`.setVerbosity` are deprecated for removal
    in v1.3, use :func:`.confProDy` instead which save changes permanently.

  * :meth:`.NMA.getModes` and :meth:`.ModeSet.getModes` methods are deprecated
    for removal in v1.3, use :func:`list`, e.g. ``list(model)``, instead.


**Bugfixes**:

  * Fixed a bug in :ref:`prody-contacts` command that arose problems when
    when selecting a subset of the target atoms.

:ref:`nmwiz`
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Improvements**:

  * :guilabel:`ProDy Interface` shows the size of the trajectory output file
    for PCA calculations.

  * :guilabel:`Mode Graphics Options` allows for copying arrows settings from
    one mode to another.

  * Color scale method and midpoint for protein coloring based on mobility and
    bfactors can be adjusted from :guilabel:`Protein Graphics Options` panel.
